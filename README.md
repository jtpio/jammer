# Jammer, a server for your game jams

Jammer is a ready to use game server made to speed up game creation in the context of game jams.

## Motivation
A game jam is all about making a great game fast, so you shouldn't spend to much time in repetitive tasks.
If you want to go for a multi-player game, you're going to spend quite a lot of time on the network part, testing it, debugging it. We all know, the network never works.


This idea popped up after using HappyFunTimes in a game jam. HappyFunTimes is great, but is limited to a local network. The missing bit for us was to be able to put the game somewhere to make it accessible by everyone.
Jammer uses game sessions to make it work with multiple game running at the same time. Once your game jam is done and you just want to share your creation with the rest of the world, you can just deploy the code normally.
